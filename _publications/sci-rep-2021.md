Gamma oscillation is crucial in brain functions such as attentional selection, and is inextricably linked to both heterogeneity and noise (or so-called stochastic fluctuation) in neuronal networks. However, under coexistence of these factors, it has not been clarified how the synaptic reversal potential modulates the entraining of gamma oscillation. Here we show distinct effects of heterogeneity and noise in a population of modified theta neurons randomly coupled via GABAergic synapses. By introducing the Fokker-Planck equation and circular cumulants, we derive a set of two-cumulant macroscopic equations. In bifurcation analyses, we find a stabilizing effect of heterogeneity and a nontrivial effect of noise that results in promoting, diminishing, and shifting the oscillatory region, and is largely dependent on the reversal potential of GABAergic synapses. These findings are verified by numerical simulations of a finite-size neuronal network. Our results reveal that slight changes in reversal potential and magnitude of stochastic fluctuations can lead to immediate control of gamma oscillation, which would results in complex spatio-temporal dynamics for attentional selection and recognition.
