I am Tianyi, currently a Ph.D. student at Department of Precision Engineering, The University of Tokyo. I am working on human subject research of transcranial electrical stimulation (tES) and computational modeling, with Prof. Kiyoshi Kotani.
My research interests include brain-computer interface, computational neuroscience, and machine learning.
Please check out my [CV](https://tianyizheng.net/cv/) for more details.
