I am currently a Ph.D. student in the [Department of Precision Engineering](https://www.pe.t.u-tokyo.ac.jp/en/index.html) at [The University of Tokyo](https://www.u-tokyo.ac.jp/en/#), supervised by [Prof. Kiyoshi Kotani](https://www.k.u-tokyo.ac.jp/en/gsfs/faculty/kiyoshi_kotani/). 

My research interests include transcranial electrical stimulation, brain-computer interface, and computational neuroscience. 

I obtained an M.Eng in Precision Engineering from [The University of Tokyo](https://www.u-tokyo.ac.jp/en/#) (2021), and a double B.Eng in Safety Engineeriing and Biomedical Engineering from [Beihang University](https://ev.buaa.edu.cn) (2019).

Please check out my [CV](https://tianyizheng.net/cv/) for more details.
